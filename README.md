# Mastermind-and-WheelOfFortune-Part2

   ## Part 2. Mastermind and WheelOfFortune are Similar Games

Mastermind and WheelOfFortune are two games with similarities. The task for part 2 is to design and code a user-based Mastermind game and re-factor WheelOfFortune so that as much of the code as possible for the two games is placed in a superclass named “GuessingGame”.

Create a new project and repo for part 2 and begin with your code from part 1.

The goal of part 2 is to encapsulate code within GuessingGame so that it can be reused in WheelOfFortuned and Mastermind-- communicate with your client before coding!
